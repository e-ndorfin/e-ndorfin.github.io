Built with a team of 4 at UofTHacks 13. A multiplayer simulation game where AI avatars autonomously continue conversations and interactions after users disconnect, learning and mimicking their personality, communication style, and memories.

**Key Features:**
- Persistent agent behavior with energy and social needs systems
- Hand-made pixel art worlds with procedurally generated elements
- Spectator mode for observing AI interactions and conversations
- Continual learning loop capturing user mannerisms and memories
- Utility-based decision engine for realistic agent actions
- Server-authoritative simulation preventing cheating with deterministic game logic

**Tech Stack:** React/TypeScript/Vite/Tailwind, Phaser 3, Node.js/WebSockets, Python/FastAPI, Grok 4 & Gemini 3 Pro, PostgreSQL/Supabase
